in enhancing the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel is established. unlike previous works, where a noiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and feedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. quite interestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in the current setting. more specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is shown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. in the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known only to the destination. in the half-duplex scheme, a

asymptotically in the limits of both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (snr), and is small at all finite snr for typical distributions like rayleigh, rician, and nakagami. in the quasi-static case,

cases. based on this volume formula, several bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization rate is sufficiently high. the lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic rate distortion tradeoff. we also show that random codes are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. finally, we discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory. a geometric interpretation in the grassmann manifold is developed for capacity calculation of additive white gaussian noise channel. further, the derived distortion rate function is beneficial to characterizing the effect of beamforming matrix selection in multi-antenna communications.", "date_create": "2007-05-16", "area": "cs.it math.it", "authors": ["dai", "rider", "liu"]}, {"idpaper": "0705.3261",

communication systems, the number of active users varies with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. thus, techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also that number, play a central role in those systems. an example of application of these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (mud). in typical mud analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of users entitled to access the system. this assumption is often overly pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one may impair performance.   the main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the system. the tool whose use we advocate is random-set theory: applying this, we derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters comprises an unknown number of elements. in addition, we can derive bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a posteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this density to derive optimum detectors. in this paper we restrict ourselves to interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.",

compensated for at the receiver before symbol recovery. this paper proposes a new approach for blind cfo estimation and symbol recovery. the received base-band signal is over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (mimo) problem. by applying blind mimo system estimation techniques, the system response is estimated and used to subsequently transform the multiple cfos estimation problem into many independent single cfo estimation problems. furthermore, an initial estimate of the cfo is obtained from the phase of the mimo

naturally distinguishing between regularity and randomness. we start from the simple principle that model variables should, as much as possible, render the future and past conditionally independent. from this, we construct an objective function for model making whose extrema embody the trade-off between a model's structural complexity and its predictive power. the solutions correspond to a hierarchy of models that, at each level of complexity, achieve optimal predictive power at minimal cost. in the limit of maximal prediction the resulting optimal model identifies a process's intrinsic organization by extracting the underlying causal states. in this limit, the model's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which is known to be minimal for achieving maximum prediction. examples show how theory building can profit from analyzing a process's causal compressibility, which is reflected in the optimal models' rate-distortion curve--the process's characteristic for optimally balancing structure and noise at different levels of representation.", "date_create": "2007-08-04", "area": "physics.data-an cond-mat.stat-mech cs.it cs.lg math-ph math.it math.mp math.st

bounds in a given region of the snr and are invertible, as well as easily tractable for further analysis. this concept is motivated by the fact that communication systems often operate with performance in a certain region of interest (roi) and, thus, it may be advantageous to have tighter bounds within this region instead of generic bounds valid for all snrs. we present a possible

channel and compute achievable ergodic rates when channel state information is acquired at the receivers via downlink training and it is provided to the transmitter by channel state feedback. unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel state feedback schemes are analyzed and compared under various assumptions. digital feedback is shown to be potentially superior when the feedback channel uses per channel state coefficient is larger than 1. also, we show that by proper design of the digital feedback link, errors in the feedback have a minor effect even if simple uncoded modulation is used on the feedback channel. we discuss first the case of an unfaded awgn feedback channel with orthogonal access and then the case of fading mimo multi-access (mimo-mac). we show that by exploiting the mimo-mac nature of the uplink channel, a much better scaling of the feedback channel resource with the number of base station antennas can be achieved. finally, for the case of delayed feedback, we show that in the realistic case where the fading process has (normalized) maximum doppler frequency shift 0 < f < 1/2, a fraction 1 - 2f of the optimal multiplexing gain is achievable. the general conclusion of this work is that very significant downlink throughput is achievable with simple and efficient channel state feedback, provided that the feedback link is properly

wireless networks, particularly a theory capable of describing the fundamental performance limits of mobile ad hoc networks (manets). a manet is a peer-to-peer network with no pre-existing infrastructure. manets are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop, relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. the lack of a manet capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and community mesh networks. information theory, which has been vital for links and centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized wireless networks. even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly characterize the limits of deployed manets it must overcome three key roadblocks. first, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of unbounded delay and reliability. second, spatial and timescale decompositions have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of wireless networks. third, a useful network capacity theory must integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and feedback. this paper describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory that we refer to as non-equilibrium information

however, need to adjust their protocol based on knowledge about the locations of the primary nodes to bring little loss to the primary network's throughput. by introducing preservation regions around primary receivers and avoidance regions around primary base stations, we propose two modified multihop routing protocols for the cognitive users. base on percolation theory, we show that when the secondary network is denser than the primary network, both networks can simultaneously achieve the same throughput scaling law as a stand-alone network. furthermore, the primary network throughput is subject to only a vanishingly fractional loss. specifically, for the ad hoc and the infrastructure-supported primary models, the primary network achieves sum throughputs of order $n^{1/2}$ and

questions: (1)theoretically, should we increase or decrease transmission power to maximize network capacity? (2) theoretically, how much network capacity gain can we achieve by power control? (3) under realistic situations, how do power control, link scheduling and routing interact with each other? under which scenarios can we expect a large capacity gain by using higher transmission power? to answer these questions, firstly, we prove that the optimal network capacity is a non-decreasing function of transmission power. secondly, we prove that the optimal network capacity can be increased unlimitedly by higher transmission power in some network configurations. however, when nodes are distributed uniformly, the gain of optimal network capacity by higher transmission power is upper-bounded by a positive constant. thirdly, we discuss why network capacity in practice may increase or decrease with higher transmission power under different scenarios using carrier sensing and the minimum hop-count routing. extensive simulations are carried out to verify our analysis.", "date_create": "2008-01-29", "area": "cs.ni cs.pf", "authors": ["wang", "lui", "chiu"]}, {"idpaper":

vertex. the player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the maximum amount of water in any cup at any time.   the geometric mbp is a continuous-time version of the mbp: the cups are points in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at a constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. again, the player's objective is to minimize the backlog.   we show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the mbp has a lower bound of $\\omega(d)$, where $d$ is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete mbp) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric mbp). therefore we focus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper bound on the absolute value of the backlog.   for the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of $\\omega(d)$, and the deamortization analysis of dietz and sleator gives an upper bound of $o(d\\log n)$ for $n$ cups. our main result is a tight upper bound for the geometric

real input with signal-to-noise ratio (snr) of snr. an upper bound on the capacity is 1/2 log(1+ snr) bits per transmitter per use of the medium-access phase and broadcast phase of the bi-directional relay channel. we show that using lattice codes and lattice decoding, we can obtain a rate of 1/2 log(0.5 + snr) bits per transmitter, which is essentially optimal at high snrs. the main idea is to decode the sum of the codewords modulo a lattice at the relay followed by a broadcast phase which performs slepian-wolf coding with structured codes. for asymptotically low snr's, jointly decoding the two transmissions at the relay (mac channel) is shown to be optimal. we also show that if the two transmitters use identical lattices with minimum angle decoding, we can achieve the same rate of 1/2

unstructured approaches while attempting to maintain the structure at various levels of protocol stack. the primary focus of this paper is to investigate construction and maintenance of scale-free topologies in a distributed manner without requiring global topology information at the time when nodes join or leave. we consider the uncooperative behavior of peers by limiting the number of neighbors to a pre-defined hard cutoff value (i.e., no peer is a major hub), and the ad-hoc behavior of peers by rewiring the neighbors of nodes leaving the network. we also investigate the effect of these hard cutoffs and rewiring of ad-hoc nodes on the p2p search efficiency.", "date_create": "2008-06-14", "area": "cs.dc", "authors": ["guclu", "kumari", "yuksel"]}, {"idpaper": "0806.3653",

femtocell sinrs. we provide a link budget analysis which enables simple and accurate performance insights in a two-tier network. a distributed utility-based sinr adaptation at femtocells is proposed in order to alleviate cross-tier interference at the macrocell from cochannel femtocells. the foschini-miljanic (fm) algorithm is a special case of the adaptation. each femtocell maximizes their individual utility consisting of a sinr based reward less an incurred cost (interference to the macrocell). numerical results show greater than 30% improvement in mean femtocell sinrs relative to fm. in the event that cross-tier interference prevents a cellular user from obtaining its sinr target, an algorithm is proposed that reduces transmission powers of the strongest femtocell interferers. the algorithm ensures that a cellular user achieves its sinr target even with 100 femtocells/cell-site, and requires a worst case sinr reduction of only 16% at femtocells. these results motivate design of

statistical physics, where multiple links are allowed to update their states in a single time slot. the algorithm generates collision-free transmission schedules while explicitly taking collisions into account during the control phase of the protocol, thus relaxing the perfect csma assumption. more importantly, the algorithm allows us to incorporate mechanisms which lead to very good delay performance while retaining the throughput-optimality property. it also resolves the hidden and exposed terminal problems associated with wireless networks.", "date_create": "2009-01-15", "area":

of the tight algebraic connection between qc codes and convolutional codes, we can state similar results for the free hamming distance of convolutional codes. in fact, some qc code statements are established by first proving the corresponding convolutional code statements and then using a result by tanner that says that the minimum hamming distance of a qc code is upper bounded by the free

analyze inter-session network coding in a wired network using game theory. we assume selfish users acting strategically to maximize their own utility, leading to a resource allocation game among users. in particular, we study the well-known butterfly network topology where a bottleneck link is shared by several network coding and routing flows. we prove the existence of a nash equilibrium for a wide range of utility functions. we show that the number of nash equilibria can be large (even infinite) for certain choices of system parameters. this is in sharp contrast to a similar game setting with traditional packet forwarding where the nash equilibrium is always unique. we then characterize the worst-case efficiency bounds, i.e., the price-of-anarchy (poa), compared to an optimal and cooperative network design. we show that by using a novel discriminatory pricing scheme which charges encoded and forwarded packets differently, we can improve the poa. however, regardless of the discriminatory pricing scheme being used, the poa is still worse than for the case when network coding is not applied. this implies that, although inter-session network coding can improve performance compared to ordinary routing, it is significantly more sensitive to users' strategic behaviour. for example, in a butterfly network where the side links have zero cost, the efficiency can be as low as 25%. if the side links have non-zero cost, then the efficiency can further reduce to only 20%. these results generalize the well-known result of guaranteed 67% worst-case efficiency for traditional

quantification (uq) in which the uq objectives and the assumptions/information set are brought to the forefront. this framework, which we call \\emph{optimal uncertainty quantification} (ouq), is based on the observation that, given a set of assumptions and information about the problem, there exist optimal bounds on uncertainties: these are obtained as values of well-defined optimization problems corresponding to extremizing probabilities of failure, or of deviations, subject to the constraints imposed by the scenarios compatible with the assumptions and information. in particular, this framework does not implicitly impose inappropriate assumptions, nor does it repudiate relevant information. although ouq optimization problems are extremely large, we show that under general conditions they have finite-dimensional reductions. as an application, we develop \\emph{optimal concentration inequalities} (oci) of hoeffding and mcdiarmid type. surprisingly, these results show that uncertainties in input parameters, which propagate to output uncertainties in the classical sensitivity analysis paradigm, may fail to do so if the transfer functions (or probability distributions) are imperfectly known. we show how, for hierarchical structures, this phenomenon may lead to the non-propagation of uncertainties or information across scales. in addition, a general

instead, these networks are inherently dynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the ordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by existing

different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. the appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. we evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. we also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. a systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of

this goal, we introduce sybilbelief, a semi-supervised learning framework, to detect sybil nodes. sybilbelief takes a social network of the nodes in the system, a small set of known benign nodes, and, optionally, a small set of known sybils as input. then sybilbelief propagates the label information from the known benign and/or sybil nodes to the remaining nodes in the system.   we evaluate sybilbelief using both synthetic and real world social network topologies. we show that sybilbelief is able to accurately identify sybil nodes with low false positive rates and low false negative rates. sybilbelief is resilient to noise in our prior knowledge about known benign and sybil nodes. moreover, sybilbelief performs orders of magnitudes better than existing sybil classification

the seller is given $m$ samples from each of these distributions \"for free\" and chooses an auction to run on a fresh sample. how large does m need to be, as a function of the number k of bidders and eps > 0, so that a (1 - eps)-approximation of the optimal revenue is achievable?   we prove that, under standard tail conditions on the underlying distributions, m = poly(k, 1/eps) samples are

non-identical distributions, and a very close (but still constant) approximation of the optimal revenue. it effectively shows that the only way to achieve a sufficiently good constant approximation of the optimal revenue is through a detailed understanding of bidders' valuation distributions. our upper bound is constructive and applies in particular to a variant of the empirical myerson auction,

systems is difficult. even simple consistency requirements often turn out to be unrealizable because of the complicated information flow in the distributed system: not all information is available in every component, and information transmitted from other components may arrive with a delay or not at all, especially in the presence of faults. the problem of checking the distributed realizability of a temporal specification is, in general, undecidable. semi-algorithms for synthesis, such as bounded synthesis, are only useful in the positive case, where they construct an implementation for a realizable specification, but not in the negative case: if the specification is unrealizable, the search for the implementation never terminates. in this paper, we introduce counterexamples to distributed realizability and present a method for the detection of such counterexamples for specifications given in linear-time temporal logic (ltl). a counterexample consists of a set of paths, each representing a different sequence of inputs from the environment, such that, no matter how the components are implemented, the specification is violated on at least one of these paths. we present a method for finding such counterexamples both for the classic distributed realizability problem and for the fault-tolerant realizability problem. our method considers, incrementally, larger and larger sets of paths until a counterexample is found. for safety specifications in weakly ordered architectures we obtain a decision procedure, while counterexamples for full ltl and arbitrary architectures

have predominantly been based on asymptotic approximations or on simulated permutations. we show that when the number of permutations tends to infinity, the permutation p-value approaches the exact conditional enumeration p-value, and further that calculating the latter p-value is much more efficient than performing simulated permutations. we then answer two research questions. (i) which of the test statistics under study are the most powerful for monotone genetic models?

the maximum over a range of cochrane-armitage trend tests with different scores and for a constrained likelihood ratio test. for significance levels below 0.05, asymptotic approximations may give a

based on clinical protocols that often do not account for the high inter- and intra-individual variability in the patient's response. as a result, the hemoglobin level of some patients oscillates around the target range, which is associated with multiple risks and side-effects. this work proposes a methodology based on reinforcement learning (rl) to optimize esa therapy.   methods: rl is a data-driven approach for solving sequential decision-making problems that are formulated as markov decision processes (mdps). computing optimal drug administration strategies for chronic diseases is a sequential decision-making problem in which the goal is to find the best sequence of drug doses. mdps are particularly suitable for modeling these problems due to their ability to capture the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment and the stochastic nature of the underlying process. the rl algorithm employed in the proposed methodology is fitted q iteration, which stands out for its ability to make an efficient use of data.   results: the experiments reported here are based on a computational model that describes the effect of esas on the hemoglobin level. the performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the well-known q-learning algorithm and with a standard protocol. simulation results show that the performance of q-learning is
